🚀 Hangman Game Project | 2nd Project 🎮:

I built an interactive and responsive Hangman game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is simple: guess the hidden word by selecting the correct letters before running out of tries! 🧠

As the player makes wrong guesses, a part of a hangman illustration gradually appears, making the game fun and challenging. 😲 The game is fully responsive, meaning it works smoothly on both mobile and desktop screens, providing a great user experience everywhere! 📱💻

This project helped me improve my skills in web development and gave me hands-on experience with creating interactive web applications! 🔧✨
